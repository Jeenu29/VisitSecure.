VisitSecure is a smart, secure, and digital visitor management system designed for universities, offices, and gated organizations.
It replaces manual entry registers with approval-based digital passes, identity verification, and automatic access control.

Because every visit deserves security.

✨ Why VisitSecure?

Traditional visitor entry systems are:

Manual and error-prone

Easy to misuse

Hard to track and audit


VisitSecure solves this by providing:

Secure digital visitor passes

Host-controlled approvals

Time-bound access


A seamless, modern experience for both visitors and organizations


🧠 How VisitSecure Works

Visitor Request:
A visitor submits a visit request with basic details and the host’s unique ID.

Identity Verification:
The visitor uploads a live selfie to ensure authenticity and prevent misuse.

Host Approval:
The host receives a notification and can approve or reject the request instantly.

Digital Pass Generation:
Once approved, a secure digital visitor pass is generated.

Auto Deactivation:
The pass automatically expires after a fixed time (e.g. 6 hours).
